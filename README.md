# ML-for-histopathology
Histopathology is the study of diseases of tissues that involves the examination of microscopic slides consisting of tissues, cells, etc, that has been extensively used for the diagnosis of various forms of cancer. Histopathologists are medical experts who analyze cells or tissues under the microscope to make a diagnosis in order to come to a consensus regarding nature, the severity of diseases, and plan of action with regards to patient care. Medical imaging for diagnosis using Machine Learning and Classical computer vision is a very fastly growing area of research. Deep Learning, especially CNNs has become the methodology of choice when it comes to digital histopathology.
In those project I applied different deep neural networks for medical image classification  like as EfficientNet, VGG16, Ensemble models and Convolutional Neural Networks, assessing their performance with several metrics.
